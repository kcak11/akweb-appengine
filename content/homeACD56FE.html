<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">More about me</span>
<br/>
I am challenging myself to work on Java Technologies every day and learn a minimum of 2 new things each week. My intention is to explore ideas and techniques and push myself beyond my comfort zone. I will be working in a series with several different situations. My interests at this time are designing a secure transaction handler (STH) which can be integrated in a framework. I will be posting exercises and challenges for myself and any others who wish to join in this amazing Journey.
